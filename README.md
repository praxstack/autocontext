<!-- autocontext-readme-hero:end -->

autocontext is a harness. You point it at a goal in plain language. It iterates against real evaluation, keeps what worked, throws out what didn't, and produces a structured trace of the work plus the artifacts, playbooks, datasets, and (optionally) a distilled local model that the next agent inherits. Repeated runs get better, not just different.

**Documentation:** [autocontext.ai/docs](https://autocontext.ai/docs) · [quickstart](https://autocontext.ai/docs/get-started/quickstart) · [CLI reference](https://autocontext.ai/docs/cli/reference) · [changelog](https://autocontext.ai/docs/changelog)

## Try It In 30 Seconds

The fastest path uses our **Pi runtime**, a local coding agent that handles its own auth. No API key plumbing, no provider config: install Pi, install autocontext, point one at the other.

```bash
uv tool install autocontext==0.6.0

AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER=pi \
AUTOCONTEXT_PI_COMMAND=pi \
autoctx solve \
  "improve customer-support replies for billing disputes" \
  --iterations 3
```

Pi runs locally as a subprocess and emits live traces back into the harness. For a hosted Pi, set `AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER=pi-rpc` and `AUTOCONTEXT_PI_RPC_ENDPOINT` instead.

Prefer TypeScript? Same surface, same command:

```bash
bun add -g autoctx@0.6.0
AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER=pi bunx autoctx solve \
  "improve customer-support replies for billing disputes" \
  --iterations 5 --json
```

Already on Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Azure, Claude CLI, Codex CLI, or MLX? Set `AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER` and the matching credential env var:

```bash
AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER=anthropic \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
autoctx solve "..." --iterations 3
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for every provider's variables, or use the live provider guide at [autocontext.ai/docs/providers](https://autocontext.ai/docs/providers). Prefer to clone and run a starter? [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) has copy-paste recipes for Python CLI, Claude Code MCP, Python SDK, TypeScript library usage, and the experimental TypeScript agent handler surface.

## Or Just Talk To Your Agent

If you already work inside a coding agent, you can wire autocontext in once and give the agent a natural-language entry point. Hermes and other terminal-capable agents should start with the CLI-backed skill; MCP remains available for clients that want a tool-catalog protocol.

**Pi** ships an autocontext skill out of the box. Install the published Pi package and Pi loads natural-language wrappers over live tools such as `autocontext_solve_scenario`, `autocontext_evaluate_output`, `autocontext_run_improvement_loop`, `autocontext_run_status`, and `autocontext_list_scenarios`.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-autocontext@0.2.5
```

Pi is on a separate package line: `pi-autocontext@0.2.5` currently depends on `autoctx@^0.5.1`. Use it for the current Pi tools/skills, and use `autocontext==0.6.0` or `autoctx@0.6.0` directly when you need the 0.6 runtime features until the next Pi extension release updates its bundled TypeScript dependency.

Then you just ask:

> "Solve: improve customer-support replies for billing disputes."
>
> "Judge this output against this rubric and improve it until it scores 0.85."

**Claude Code** (and any other MCP client) gets the same surface by adding one entry to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "autocontext": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/autocontext", "autoctx", "mcp-serve"],
      "env": { "AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER": "pi", "AUTOCONTEXT_PI_COMMAND": "pi" }
    }
  }
}
```

After that, Python MCP exposes prefixed tools such as `autocontext_solve_scenario`, `autocontext_evaluate_output`, `autocontext_run_improvement_loop`, `autocontext_run_status`, `autocontext_list_scenarios`, `autocontext_export_skill`, and `autocontext_search_strategies`. It also exposes runtime-session readers as `autocontext_list_runtime_sessions`, `autocontext_get_runtime_session`, and `autocontext_get_runtime_session_timeline`, with unprefixed aliases for parity with TypeScript MCP; Python runtime-backed `run` and `solve` role calls populate those logs automatically. The TypeScript package exposes the same capabilities with its documented tool names via `bunx autoctx mcp-serve`.

**Hermes Agent** can load a CLI-first skill and inspect Hermes Curator state without MCP:

```bash
cd autocontext
uv run autoctx hermes export-skill --output ~/.hermes/skills/autocontext/SKILL.md --json
# Add progressive-disclosure reference files alongside SKILL.md
uv run autoctx hermes export-skill \
    --output ~/.hermes/skills/autocontext/SKILL.md \
    --with-references --json
uv run autoctx hermes inspect --json
```

Full integration guide: [autocontext.ai/docs/agents](https://autocontext.ai/docs/agents) and [autocontext/docs/agent-integration.md](autocontext/docs/agent-integration.md).

## What You Get Back

Every run leaves a structured record on disk. Replay it, diff it, export it, feed it back into training.

```
runs/<run_id>/
├── trace.jsonl              # every prompt, tool call, and outcome, in order
├── generations/
│   ├── gen_1/
│   │   ├── strategy.json    # what the competitor proposed
│   │   ├── analysis.md      # what the analyst observed
│   │   └── score.json       # how it was evaluated
│   └── gen_2/ ...
├── report.md                # human-readable summary of the whole run
└── artifacts/               # files, configs, packages the run produced

knowledge/<scenario>/
├── playbook.md              # accumulated lessons that carried forward
├── hints.md                 # competitor hints that survived the curator
└── tools/                   # any helper tools the architect generated
```

A `playbook.md` is plain markdown the next run reads as context:

```markdown
<!-- PLAYBOOK_START -->

## Billing dispute replies

- Always restate the disputed charge in the first sentence; refunds requested without
  explicit confirmation cause loops.
- "Pending" charges are not yet billable. Don't promise a refund until status flips
  to `posted`. Verified gen_4, regressed in gen_7 when omitted.
- Empathy + specific next step beats empathy alone. Escalation rate dropped from
0.31 to 0.12 once the second sentence named the next-step owner.
<!-- PLAYBOOK_END -->
```

A `trace.jsonl` line is one event:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-04-28T17:42:11Z",
  "gen": 4,
  "role": "competitor",
  "event": "strategy_proposed",
  "score": 0.78,
  "tokens_in": 1840,
  "tokens_out": 612,
  "strategy_id": "s_4f2a"
}
```

Inspect, replay, or compare any of it:

```bash
uv run autoctx list
uv run autoctx status <run_id>
uv run autoctx replay <run_id> --generation 2
```

## How It Works

Inside each run, five roles cooperate:

- **competitor** proposes a strategy or artifact for the task
- **analyst** explains what happened and why
- **coach** turns that analysis into playbook updates and future hints
- **architect** proposes tools or harness changes when the loop is stuck
- **curator** gates what knowledge is allowed to persist across runs

Strategies are evaluated through scenario execution, staged validation, and gating. Weak changes are rolled back. Successful changes accumulate as reusable knowledge that future runs (and future agents) inherit automatically.

The full vocabulary (Scenario, Task, Mission, Campaign, Run, Verifier, Knowledge, Artifact, Budget, Policy) lives in the [concept docs](https://autocontext.ai/docs/concepts) and [docs/concept-model.md](docs/concept-model.md).

## Capture What's Happening In Production

autocontext can sit alongside your live application and record what your agents do, then turn that into training data. Wrap your existing Anthropic or OpenAI client once:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from autocontext.production_traces import instrument_client

client = instrument_client(Anthropic(), app="billing-bot", env="prod")
# use `client` exactly like before; calls are captured to JSONL with content blocks,
# cache-aware usage, and Anthropic-native outcome taxonomy.
```

```ts
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
import { instrumentClient } from "autoctx/production-traces";

const client = instrumentClient(new Anthropic(), { app: "billing-bot", env: "prod" });
```

Then build scoped datasets from the captured traces:

```bash
uv run autoctx build-dataset \
  --app billing-bot --provider anthropic \
  --env prod --outcome success \
  --output training/billing.jsonl
```

And distill them into a smaller local model with MLX (Apple Silicon) or CUDA (Linux GPUs):

```bash
uv run autoctx train --scenario support_triage --data training/billing.jsonl --time-budget 300
```

<!-- autocontext-whats-new:start -->
## What's New in 0.6.0

- **CLI contract parity** aligns the Python and TypeScript `autoctx` command surfaces around the shared canonical contract, including capabilities, mission lifecycle commands, queue commands, scenario creation, serve/MCP paths, show/watch, status behavior, and aliases.
- **Contract probes** add terminal, directory, service, artifact, cleanup, media, and distributed probe families, plus `autoctx probes check` and `autoctx probes extract` for harness verification.
- **Mission checkpoints** now share a cross-runtime checkpoint contract with collision-free filenames, camelCase/snake_case loader interop, atomic restore behavior, and async-boundary guards.
<!-- autocontext-whats-new:end -->

## On main (unreleased)

- **Training pipeline work** adds opt-in teacher-reasoning distillation, sampling controls, MLX-LM fine-tuning, score-conditioned generation, reward-weighted loss, and self-improving local-training loops. These features are on `main` and in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), but they are not included in the pinned `0.6.0` packages yet.

## Providers, Runtimes, Executors

**LLM providers**: Anthropic (with `instrument_client` capture), OpenAI-compatible (vLLM, Ollama, Hermes), Gemini, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, MLX (Apple Silicon), CUDA (Linux GPUs), Pi (CLI and RPC).

**Agent runtimes**: Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Hermes CLI, Direct API, Pi variants, plus branch-aware session and persistent Pi RPC for local agent loops.

**Executors**: Local subprocess, SSH remote, Monty (`pydantic-monty` sandbox), PrimeIntellect remote sandbox. Gondolin is reserved as an optional fail-closed microVM backend until its adapter is wired.

**Harness profiles and hooks**: The Python control plane supports a Pi-shaped lean profile that caps prompt context during generation and exports a minimal tool-affordance allowlist for agent surfaces that enforce tool gating. Semantic prompt compactions are recorded as Pi-shaped JSONL entries under each run; the TypeScript package now includes a mirrored deterministic prompt compactor plus `ArtifactStore` ledger read/write/latest APIs for standalone npm runs. Python and TypeScript runs can load `AUTOCONTEXT_EXTENSIONS`; Python extensions are Python modules, while TypeScript extensions are JavaScript/ESM modules that register hooks around context assembly, semantic compaction, provider calls, judge calls, artifact writes, and run lifecycle events.

A deterministic offline provider exists for the test suite. Configuration matrix: [`.env.example`](.env.example) and [docs/concept-model.md](docs/concept-model.md).

## FAQ

**Is autocontext a benchmark?**
No. It's a harness for improving real agent behavior on real work. Benchmarks (the 11 scenario families) are one of many surfaces; you can also point it at production tasks, missions, or simulations.

**How is this different from DSPy, Inspect, TextGrad, or a prompt optimizer?**
Those tools optimize prompts. autocontext takes a goal in plain language, generates the scenario, runs a multi-role loop with verifier-driven gating, and produces transferable artifacts (playbooks, datasets, distilled models) that the next run inherits. Prompt optimization is a special case.

**Do I need API keys?**
No. The Pi runtime runs locally and handles its own auth. Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Azure, MLX, and Claude/Codex CLI are all opt-in via env vars.

**Where does the knowledge live?**
On your filesystem. Runs go to `runs/`, accumulated knowledge to `knowledge/`. Indexed metadata is in SQLite. Everything is inspectable, diffable, and portable.

**Can my coding agent drive autocontext directly?**
Yes. Wire `autoctx mcp-serve` (or `bunx autoctx mcp-serve`) into Claude Code, Cursor, or Pi as an MCP server, and the agent gets natural-language access to `solve`, `judge`, `improve`, `status`, `export_skill`, and the rest. See [Or Just Talk To Your Agent](#or-just-talk-to-your-agent).
