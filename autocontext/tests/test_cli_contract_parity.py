"""Cross-runtime CLI parity audit (Python side).

The forward direction (contract -> Typer registration) is already
covered by ``tests/test_cli_contract.py``. The audit below adds the
REVERSE direction plus cross-runtime invariants so accidental drift
surfaces immediately.

What this pins:

1. **Reverse direction**: every top-level Typer command observed on
   the live ``autocontext.cli.app`` is either contracted, listed
   as a contracted alias, or named in
   ``UNCONTRACTED_TOP_LEVEL_ALLOWLIST``. Adding a new top-level
   command without a contract entry (or allowlist line) fails the
   test, so the operator is forced to either advertise it in the
   contract or document why it stays uncontracted.

2. **Alias registration**: every contracted alias path must
   correspond to an observed top-level Typer command. Pins that
   the legacy invocations (`autoctx mcp-serve`,
   `autoctx new-scenario`) still work after future refactors.

3. **Cross-runtime path equality**: a command id with both
   ``python.yes`` and ``typescript.yes`` must declare the SAME
   canonical ``path``. The contract is a single source of truth so
   this is trivially true per-entry, but the assertion documents
   the invariant and traps a hand-edit that introduces a per-
   runtime path divergence.

4. **Cross-runtime id uniqueness**: command ids are unique within
   the contract; the assertion is a sanity backstop for the
   above.
