# Persistent Host Worker

Use this shape when you want Autocontext to keep accepting queued work while a server stays online.

Run the HTTP API and queue worker as separate long-lived processes against the same durable workspace:

```bash
export AUTOCONTEXT_DB_PATH=/srv/autoctx/runs/autocontext.sqlite3
export AUTOCONTEXT_RUNS_ROOT=/srv/autoctx/runs
export AUTOCONTEXT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT=/srv/autoctx/knowledge

uv run autoctx serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
uv run autoctx worker --poll-interval 5 --concurrency 2
```

For the TypeScript package, the equivalent worker surface is:

```bash
autoctx serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
autoctx worker --poll-interval 5 --concurrency 2
```

`autoctx queue` and MCP `queue_task` calls write into the task queue. `autoctx worker` wraps the existing `TaskRunner`, polls that queue, processes tasks in priority order, and persists task results back into the configured store.

If the selected provider/runtime is stateful and persistent, for example persistent Pi RPC, worker concurrency is forced to `1`. Use non-persistent provider instances or a hosted storage/runtime adapter when you need true parallel task execution.

## Trust and Credential Boundary

This persistent-host shape is single-tenant or trusted-org infrastructure. Treat the API process, worker process, SQLite DB, runs root, knowledge root, mounted repository, service account, and environment file as one trust boundary. It is suitable for a developer machine, a CI worker, or one trusted organization; it is not a hosted multi-tenant SaaS control plane.

If `autoctx serve` binds beyond loopback, put it behind TLS, authentication, and authorization before exposing it to other users. Provider keys, SCM credentials, sandbox API keys, and webhook secrets may be supplied through the host environment for this single-tenant shape, but they must not be baked into images or written into prompts, runtime-session timelines, background-session summaries, lifecycle hook payloads, or outcome metadata.

Shared GitHub App credentials or bot tokens for branch/PR workflows are acceptable only inside one tenant or trusted organization with explicit admin consent. Cross-customer hosted PR creation requires a product adapter with per-tenant GitHub App installations or user OAuth tokens, scoped credential brokering, audit, and revocation. See [Background execution trust boundaries and credential model](../../docs/background-execution-trust-boundaries.md) before claiming hosted or multi-tenant safety.

## Durable State

Keep these paths on persistent storage:

- `runs/`: run records, event streams, task queue SQLite DB, and per-run artifacts
- `knowledge/`: playbooks, hints, custom scenarios, and reusable context
- `skills/` and `.claude/skills/`: optional exported skills when those surfaces are enabled

SQLite is the current open-source queue store. Treat the DB path as a single-writer operational boundary unless you explicitly deploy with a storage adapter that provides stronger multi-worker semantics. A Postgres-backed queue can fit the same `serve + worker` shape, but should be introduced behind the storage abstraction rather than by changing task-runner behavior.

## Operational Notes

Use `--once` for cron, smoke tests, or CI:

```bash
uv run autoctx worker --once --concurrency 4 --json
```

Use `--max-empty-polls` for bounded workers that should exit after the queue drains:

```bash
uv run autoctx worker --poll-interval 1 --max-empty-polls 3
```

On a service manager such as systemd, run `serve` and `worker` as separate units with the same environment file. Restarting the worker should not require restarting the API process as long as both use the same durable paths.

### systemd Sketch

Use one environment file for both units:

```ini
# /etc/autoctx/autoctx.env
AUTOCONTEXT_DB_PATH=/srv/autoctx/runs/autocontext.sqlite3
AUTOCONTEXT_RUNS_ROOT=/srv/autoctx/runs
AUTOCONTEXT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT=/srv/autoctx/knowledge
AUTOCONTEXT_AGENT_PROVIDER=pi
AUTOCONTEXT_PI_COMMAND=pi
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/autoctx-serve.service
[Unit]
Description=Autocontext HTTP API
After=network-online.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/srv/autoctx/app/autocontext
EnvironmentFile=/etc/autoctx/autoctx.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/uv run autoctx serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/autoctx-worker.service
[Unit]
Description=Autocontext queue worker
After=network-online.target autoctx-serve.service

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/srv/autoctx/app/autocontext
EnvironmentFile=/etc/autoctx/autoctx.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/uv run autoctx worker --poll-interval 5 --concurrency 2
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Container Sketch

Keep the same image for API and worker, but run separate processes and mount the same durable volume:

```yaml
services:
  autoctx-serve:
    image: ghcr.io/your-org/autoctx:latest
    command: ["uv", "run", "autoctx", "serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
    env_file: .env.autoctx
    volumes:
      - autoctx-state:/srv/autoctx
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  autoctx-worker:
    image: ghcr.io/your-org/autoctx:latest
    command: ["uv", "run", "autoctx", "worker", "--poll-interval", "5", "--concurrency", "2"]
    env_file: .env.autoctx
    volumes:
      - autoctx-state:/srv/autoctx

volumes:
  autoctx-state:
```

The image build, reverse proxy, auth, TLS, and secret distribution are deployment-specific. Do not bake provider API keys, SCM tokens, GitHub App private keys, webhook secrets, or sandbox API keys into images.

## Storage Adapter Contract

The OSS worker now depends on a narrow task queue contract instead of SQLite inheritance:

- Python: `autocontext.execution.TaskQueueStore` / `TaskQueueEnqueueStore`
- TypeScript: `TaskQueueWorkerStore` / `TaskQueueEnqueueStore`, with methods that may return values directly or as promises.

Adapters must provide atomic task claim, task lookup, completion, failure, and enqueue semantics. SQLite is the bundled implementation. A hosted Postgres adapter can add leases, heartbeats, retries, and multi-worker coordination behind that contract without changing `TaskRunner`.

What should stay outside the OSS contract is the hosted control plane: tenant scheduling, billing, policy UI, fleet routing, secret brokering, and managed retention/audit workflows.

## Sandbox Boundary

The worker uses the same evaluator/executor settings as the rest of Autocontext. Use Monty when you need in-process interpreter guardrails, PrimeIntellect or SSH when you need an external execution host, and reserve Gondolin for the optional microVM backend once it is wired. `AUTOCONTEXT_EXECUTOR_MODE=gondolin` is intentionally fail-closed today so deployments do not silently fall back to local execution when they expected a VM isolation boundary.

For future Gondolin work, implement the public backend contracts rather than changing task-runner behavior:

- Python: `autocontext.execution.executors.gondolin_contract.GondolinBackend`
- TypeScript: `GondolinBackend` and `createDefaultGondolinSandboxPolicy` from `autoctx`
