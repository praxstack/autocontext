# MLX Host Training Setup (Apple Silicon)

## Overview

autocontext's `autoctx train` command uses [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) to fine-tune local models from exported run data. MLX requires direct access to Apple's Metal GPU framework, which means training must run on the macOS host, not inside a Docker sandbox.

Docker containers on macOS run inside a Linux VM and cannot access Metal. The MLX Python package may install on Linux aarch64, but training cannot complete without a Metal-capable Apple Silicon host. Host-side Python environments also cannot be executed directly from the sandbox when they point to macOS-native binaries.

## Prerequisites

| Component         | Version               | Install                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Apple Silicon Mac | M1/M2/M3/M4           | -                          |
| macOS             | Tahoe (26.x) or later | -                          |
| Homebrew          | Latest                | [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) |
| Python            | 3.12+                 | `brew install python@3.12` |
| uv                | 0.10+                 | `brew install uv`          |

The package requires Python 3.11+, but Homebrew Python 3.12 is the safest host setup for MLX on Apple Silicon.

## Installation

### 1. Install Python and uv

```bash
brew install python@3.12
brew install uv
```

### 2. Sync the MLX dependency group

From the `autocontext/` directory:

```bash
cd <project-root>/autocontext
uv sync --group dev --extra mlx
```

This installs the MLX-specific extras:

- `mlx>=0.30.0`
- `rustbpe>=0.1.0`
- `tiktoken>=0.11.0`
- `safetensors>=0.4.0`

## Running Training

Export JSONL data from completed runs:

```bash
cd <project-root>/autocontext
uv run autoctx export-training-data \
  --scenario grid_ctf \
  --all-runs \
  --output training/grid_ctf.jsonl
```

Run training on the host:

```bash
cd <project-root>/autocontext
uv run autoctx train \
  --scenario grid_ctf \
  --data /absolute/path/to/training/grid_ctf.jsonl \
  --time-budget 300
```

Use absolute paths for `--data`. The CLI resolves relative paths from the current working directory, which may differ from the location that originally produced the training data.

The training loop writes its workspace under `runs/train_<scenario>/` and produces a checkpoint bundle that `MLXProvider` can load for local inference.

### Pretrained fine-tuning (`--backend mlxlm`)

The default `mlx` backend trains a small GPT from scratch. The `mlxlm` backend instead
LoRA/DoRA-fine-tunes a _pretrained_ [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm)
model on the curated (and optionally score-conditioned) records, so the model starts
from a strong prior over JSON / numbers / structure. It uses the base model's own
tokenizer with a natural-language prompt/completion and completion-only loss
(`--mask-prompt`).

Install the extra: `uv sync --group dev --extra mlxlm`.

| Flag               | Default                                    | Effect                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--backend mlxlm`  | `mlx`                                      | Select the pretrained-finetune backend.                          |
| `--base-model`     | `mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit` | Pretrained mlx-lm model (HF repo or local path).                 |
| `--fine-tune-type` | `lora`                                     | `lora`, `dora` (weight-decomposed, usually stronger), or `full`. |
| `--num-layers`     | `8`                                        | Number of layers to fine-tune (fewer = less memory).             |

```bash
uv run autoctx train --backend mlxlm \
  --data /absolute/path/to/training/grid_ctf.jsonl \
  --base-model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit \
  --fine-tune-type dora --num-layers 8 \
  --elite-fraction 0.3 --score-conditioned
```

Curation (`--elite-fraction` / `--dedupe`) and `--score-conditioned` apply to this
backend too (score-conditioning is expressed as a natural-language quality directive
in the prompt rather than the `<|quality|>` token). The fine-tuned adapters are written
under the run's `adapters/` directory.

### Record curation (optional)

These flags curate the training records before tokenization (defaults are a no-op,
so omitting them reproduces the previous behavior). Curation is applied to the
training split only; the held-out validation split is untouched.

| Flag                      | Default | Range    | Effect                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--elite-fraction`        | `1.0`   | `(0, 1]` | Train on only the top fraction of records by score (e.g. `0.25` keeps the best quarter). Rejection-sampling fine-tuning: imitate the best of the distribution, not its mean. |
| `--dedupe`                | off     | flag     | Drop duplicate constructions (exact by canonical strategy JSON), keeping the highest-scoring representative.                                                                 |
| `--dedupe-near-threshold` | `1.0`   | `(0, 1]` | With `--dedupe`, also drop near-duplicates at/above this character-shingle Jaccard similarity. `1.0` = exact only; e.g. `0.9` removes near-identical strategies.             |

Out-of-range values are rejected before training starts. Example (train on the
best 20% with exact + near deduplication, and keep the best-by-validation-loss
checkpoint):

```bash
uv run autoctx train \
  --scenario grid_ctf \
  --data /absolute/path/to/training/grid_ctf.jsonl \
  --elite-fraction 0.2 \
  --dedupe --dedupe-near-threshold 0.9 \
  --val-select
```

The published model artifact records the curation settings plus the raw and
curated record counts (`data_stats`) so a trained model's data split is reproducible.

### Score-conditioned generation (optional)

`--score-conditioned` trains the model to map a target quality onto a construction
(Decision-Transformer / Quark style): each training example gets a `<|quality|>`
control token before the strategy, derived from its score (quantized into 5 buckets
over `[0, 1]`). At assessment/inference the model is prompted with the **top** bucket,
steering it toward high-quality outputs rather than the dataset mean.

The control token is **gated**: it is reserved (one extra vocab slot, id appended
last) and registered only for score-conditioned runs, so the default model vocab and
architecture are byte-identical unless the flag is set. The conditioning contract is
persisted in the checkpoint `config.json` (`score_conditioned`, `num_quality_buckets`)
and in the registry `data_stats`, and `MLXProvider` reapplies the top-bucket prompt
automatically when serving a score-conditioned checkpoint. Pairs naturally with
`--elite-fraction` (train on the best, then ask for the best):

```bash
uv run autoctx train \
  --scenario grid_ctf \
  --data /absolute/path/to/training/grid_ctf.jsonl \
  --score-conditioned --elite-fraction 0.3
```

### Self-improving loop (ReST-EM / Expert Iteration)

`autoctx self-improve` runs the outer loop that turns one-shot distillation into
ReST-EM (a.k.a. expert iteration / PatternBoost): each round trains on the current
dataset, samples constructions from the trained model and scores them in-scenario,
keeps the highest-scoring elite, appends them as new training records, and retrains
on the grown dataset. The model generates its own training data, biased toward the
best of what it can already produce, so quality compounds across rounds. This is the
self-training analogue of rejection-sampling fine-tuning, lifted from a single fit to
an iterated one.

Sampling uses a positive temperature so the collected constructions are diverse
(greedy decoding would collect identical samples and stall the loop). Sample
collection is MLX-only for now, so the loop drives the `mlx` backend.

| Flag                  | Default | Meaning                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--rounds`            | `3`     | Number of generate -> filter -> retrain rounds.         |
| `--samples-per-round` | `16`    | Constructions sampled and scored each round.            |
| `--elite-fraction`    | `0.25`  | Top fraction of each round's samples kept and appended. |
| `--train-steps`       | `100`   | Training steps per round.                               |
| `--score-conditioned` | off     | Carry score-conditioning through every round.           |

```bash
uv run autoctx self-improve \
  --scenario grid_ctf \
  --data /absolute/path/to/training/grid_ctf.jsonl \
  --output-dir runs/self_improve \
  --rounds 3 --samples-per-round 16 --elite-fraction 0.25
```

The command prints a per-round table (avg_score, samples generated, elite kept,
growing dataset size) and writes the final accumulated dataset to
`<output-dir>/final_dataset.jsonl`. Pass `--json` for the structured `history`.

## Automating Host Training for Sandboxed Agents

For sandboxed agents, especially OpenClaw agents running in Docker, the cleanest low-risk approach is a file-based host-training bridge.

### Why a File Bridge

- the sandbox cannot access Metal directly
- you do not need to expose a network service
- you do not need to grant broad host exec permissions to the sandbox
- the agent can request training asynchronously and poll for results through the shared workspace

### How It Works

1. The agent writes `request-*.json` into a watched directory.
2. A host-side `launchd` agent notices the file and runs a watcher script.
3. The watcher script invokes `uv run autoctx train` on the host.
4. The watcher writes `<request>-result.json` back to the same directory.
5. The agent polls for the result file and then loads the produced local artifact.

## Request Format

The agent writes a request file such as `request-123.json`:

```json
{
  "scenario": "grid_ctf",
  "data": "/absolute/path/to/training-data.jsonl",
  "time_budget": 60
}
```

## Result Format

Successful run:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "scenario": "grid_ctf",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-12T02:49:33Z"
}
```

Failure:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "exit_code": 1,
  "scenario": "grid_ctf",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-12T02:49:33Z"
}
```

## Reference Watcher Script

Save as `~/.openclaw/scripts/autocontext-train-watcher.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

REQUEST_DIR="$HOME/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/runs/train-requests"
AUTOCTX_DIR="$HOME/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/autocontext"
LOG="/tmp/autocontext-train-watcher.log"

echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) watcher triggered" >> "$LOG"

for req in "$REQUEST_DIR"/request-*.json; do
  [ -f "$req" ] || continue
  [[ "$req" == *-result.json ]] && continue
  [ -s "$req" ] || { echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) skipping empty file: $req" >> "$LOG"; continue; }

  BASENAME="$(basename "$req" .json)"
  RESULT_FILE="$REQUEST_DIR/${BASENAME}-result.json"

  [ -f "$RESULT_FILE" ] && continue

  echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) processing $req" >> "$LOG"

  SCENARIO=$(python3.12 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))['scenario'])" "$req" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  DATA_PATH=$(python3.12 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))['data'])" "$req" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  TIME_BUDGET=$(python3.12 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1])).get('time_budget', 60))" "$req" 2>/dev/null || echo "60")

  if [ -z "$SCENARIO" ] || [ -z "$DATA_PATH" ]; then
    echo "{\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"missing scenario or data in request\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}" > "$RESULT_FILE"
    echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) error: missing fields in $req" >> "$LOG"
    continue
  fi

  cd "$AUTOCTX_DIR"
  if /opt/homebrew/bin/uv run autoctx train --scenario "$SCENARIO" --data "$DATA_PATH" --time-budget "$TIME_BUDGET" >> "$LOG" 2>&1; then
    echo "{\"status\":\"success\",\"scenario\":\"$SCENARIO\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}" > "$RESULT_FILE"
    echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) training complete for $SCENARIO" >> "$LOG"
  else
    EXIT_CODE=$?
    echo "{\"status\":\"error\",\"exit_code\":$EXIT_CODE,\"scenario\":\"$SCENARIO\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}" > "$RESULT_FILE"
    echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) training failed ($EXIT_CODE) for $SCENARIO" >> "$LOG"
  fi
done
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod 755 ~/.openclaw/scripts/autocontext-train-watcher.sh
```

## Reference `launchd` Plist

Save as `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.autocontext.train-watcher.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.autocontext.train-watcher</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/bin/bash</string>
    <string>/Users/cirdan/.openclaw/scripts/autocontext-train-watcher.sh</string>
  </array>
  <key>WatchPaths</key>
  <array>
    <string>/Users/cirdan/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/runs/train-requests</string>
  </array>
  <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
  <dict>
    <key>PATH</key>
    <string>/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
  </dict>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key>
  <string>/tmp/autocontext-train-watcher-stdout.log</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
  <string>/tmp/autocontext-train-watcher-stderr.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Update the example paths to match your home directory and shared workspace path.

Load the agent:

```bash
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.autocontext.train-watcher.plist
launchctl list com.autocontext.train-watcher
```

## Bridge Test

Write a request:

```bash
echo '{"scenario": "grid_ctf", "data": "/absolute/path/to/training-data.jsonl", "time_budget": 60}' > ~/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/runs/train-requests/request-test.json
```

Check logs and result:

```bash
cat /tmp/autocontext-train-watcher.log
cat ~/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/runs/train-requests/request-test-result.json
```

Clean up:

```bash
rm ~/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/runs/train-requests/request-test*.json
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Gateway Exec

OpenClaw's host-exec gateway is cleaner in principle, but today it routes all exec traffic to the host rather than only the training command. That is too broad for Slack-style sandboxed agents and makes normal sandbox behavior awkward.

### HTTP Bridge

A localhost HTTP bridge is possible, but it adds a service boundary and local networking complexity without giving much over the file-based trigger model.

## Troubleshooting

### `MLX is required`

You are either running inside Docker or you have not synced the MLX extra on the host:

```bash
uv sync --group dev --extra mlx
```

### Python version errors

Install Homebrew Python and verify it:

```bash
brew install python@3.12
python3.12 --version
```

### Metal runtime failures

MLX requires Apple Silicon and a Metal-capable macOS host. Intel Macs are not supported.

### Watcher does not trigger

Check:

```bash
launchctl list com.autocontext.train-watcher
```

Also verify that:

- the watched directory exists
- request files match `request-*.json`
- the script is executable

### Permission errors on workspace files

If the sandbox created the exported data with restrictive permissions:

```bash
chmod -R u+rw ~/.openclaw/workspace/autocontext/runs/
```
