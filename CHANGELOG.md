## [Unreleased]

### Added

- AC-712: distribution path for the Hermes `autocontext` skill. Ships a committed snapshot of `render_autocontext_skill()` at `skills/autocontext/SKILL.md` plus the four AC-702 references under `skills/autocontext/references/`. CI sync invariant (`autocontext/tests/test_hermes_skill_distribution.py`, 5 tests) pins the committed bytes byte-for-byte to the renderer and rejects orphan reference files, so the snapshot can never drift silently. New `docs/hermes-skill-distribution.md` documents three install paths (Option A: `autoctx hermes export-skill --output ~/.hermes/skills/autocontext/SKILL.md --with-references`; Option B: `curl` raw URLs from `main` or a pinned SHA; Option C: shallow + sparse `git clone`), the `/reload-skills` reload story, frontmatter-based versioning, and the local-edits-as-fork pitfall. Upstream Hermes submission and `agentskills.io` / hub registration are scoped as AC-712 follow-ups so the supported install matrix is unblocked today without waiting on external approval. DRY: the renderer is still the single source of truth; the committed snapshot is generated via the shipped CLI and re-generated the same way.

- AC-709: `autoctx hermes recommend --home ~/.hermes --baseline-from training/hermes-curator-decisions.jsonl --output recommendations.jsonl [--include-protected] [--json]` is the read-only recommendation surface. Trains a baseline advisor on AC-705 export data, walks the live Hermes inventory, and emits one JSONL row per recommendation. New `autocontext.hermes.recommendations` module exposes `Recommendation` (skill_name, predicted_action, confidence, status, features, reason) and `recommend(inventory, advisor, *, include_protected, reason)`. Read-only invariant: never writes to `~/.hermes`; Curator stays the mutation owner. Protected skills (pinned / bundled / hub provenance) are filtered out by default so a recommendation cannot mistakenly target upstream-owned content; `--include-protected` surfaces them tagged `status="protected"` for audit. Same-file guard on `--baseline-from` / `--output` mirrors the AC-706 / AC-708 ingest posture. Slice-1 refactor of `autocontext.hermes.advisor`: introduces `SkillFeatures` as the inference-time input shape so advisors take features (not labeled examples), with `CuratorDecisionExample.features` bridging training to inference cleanly. `BaselineAdvisor.predict(features)` is unchanged behaviorally; the slice-1 tests update one direct call site. 13 recommendation tests + 1 refactor regression cover features bridge, advisor protocol, protected-skill filtering, include-protected audit path, JSON round-trip, default rationale per advisor type, and 4 CLI integration tests (success, same-file guard, empty training rejection, all-protected empty-output, include-protected surfacing). 186 total hermes tests pass.

- AC-769: failure-type → remediation routing on top of `FailureReport`. New `autocontext/src/autocontext/loop/remediation_router.py` pattern-matches a `FailureReport` (plus optional AC-767 `fixtures` map) into typed `RemediationHint` instances. Three built-in rules ship: `rule_off_by_one` (matches "expected X, got Y" where diff ∈ {1, BLOCK, BLOCK²} for common block sizes, plus "off-by-N" keywords) → `SmallCaseVerify`; `rule_positional_typerror` (matches `TypeError: foo() takes N positional arguments` and extracts modules from `File "..."` traceback lines) → `SurfaceSignatures`; `rule_stale_fixture` (matches `missing-substring` failures referencing a fixture key whose cached payload is older than `stale_after_days`) → `RefreshFixture`. Rules are pluggable via a `Rule` `Protocol` and `DEFAULT_RULES` list. `route_remediations(report, *, fixtures, stale_after_days, rules)` runs every rule and concatenates hints in order; `render_hints(hints)` emits a `## Suggested next moves` prompt block. Wired into the tree-search refinement loop (`loop/stage_tree_search.py`): `HypothesisNode` gains `last_errors: list[list[str]]`, `HypothesisTree.update` accepts an optional `errors_per_match` kwarg, and the refinement-prompt build site calls `remediation_hints_for_node(selected, fixtures=ctx.fixtures)` then threads the result into `build_refinement_prompt(remediation_hints=...)`. `build_refinement_prompt` gains a `remediation_hints: str = ""` opt-in kwarg (existing callers unchanged). 23 tests cover rules, router, render, the stage_tree_search wiring helper, and an end-to-end test through `build_refinement_prompt`.

- AC-767 (docs follow-up): operator-facing documentation for the authoritative ground-truth fixture loader landed in #968. New `autocontext/docs/fixture-loader.md` covers quick-start (drop a manifest at `autocontext/knowledge/<scenario>/fixtures.json`, set `AUTOCONTEXT_FIXTURE_LOADER_ENABLED=true`), manifest format (`key`, `source`, optional `expected_sha256`), cache semantics (rehash on read, source-URL change invalidates, missing manifest is a no-op), programmatic API (`FixtureManifest`, `FixtureCache`, `UrlFetcher`, `load_scenario_fixtures`, `render_fixtures`), and the settings reference. No code changes; the implementation already shipped via #968.

- AC-708 (slice 1): `autoctx hermes train-advisor --data <jsonl> --baseline --output metrics.json` lays down the data + evaluation contract for the local Hermes curator advisor. New `autocontext.hermes.advisor` module exposes a DDD domain layer: `CuratorDecisionExample` value type loaded from AC-705 export JSONL, `BaselineAdvisor` (always-majority-class with deterministic tie-break in `CANONICAL_LABELS` order), `LabelMetrics` / `AdvisorMetrics` (per-label precision/recall + overall accuracy + `insufficient_data` flag), `train_baseline()`, and `evaluate()`. `load_curator_examples` is per-line tolerant (matches AC-704 / AC-706 ingest posture): malformed JSON, missing required fields, and unknown labels skip the row rather than aborting. `INSUFFICIENT_DATA_THRESHOLD = 20` floors when per-label metrics are meaningful — datasets below the floor still get metrics back but with the flag set, addressing the AC-708 acceptance criterion "a clear 'not enough data' failure mode for small Hermes homes". The baseline establishes the floor every later trained advisor (slice 2: logistic regression / MLX / CUDA, AC-709 recommendation surface) must beat without redesigning the data contract. 15 tests cover loader robustness, baseline determinism, per-label precision/recall on a known fixture, insufficient-data thresholds, JSON-serializable metrics, and CLI integration (`--baseline --json --output`, insufficient-data warning, empty-dataset rejection).

- AC-706 (slice 2): `autoctx hermes ingest-sessions --home ~/.hermes --output traces/hermes-sessions.jsonl --redact standard|strict|off [--since <ISO>] [--limit n] [--dry-run]` reads the Hermes session SQLite DB (`<home>/state.db`) in read-only URI mode and writes one autocontext `ProductionTrace` JSONL row per session. New `autocontext.hermes.sessions` module exposes a DDD domain layer: `HermesSession`, `HermesMessage`, `HermesSessionRepository` (read-only SQLite + schema-drift tolerance + WAL/SHM sidecar independence), and `SessionDBMissing` for the "no DB to ingest" boundary. New `autocontext.hermes.session_ingest` is the application service that maps domain objects into ProductionTraces via the same `production_traces.emit.build_trace` helper that AC-704 uses (DRY). Per-message content goes through the shared `RedactionPolicy` from slice 1 (DRY across both ingest paths), so a strict-mode user-pattern set behaves identically for trajectories and sessions. The `RAW_CONTENT_WARNING` opt-in marker from slice 1 is reused so `--redact off --json` surfaces the same audit signal for sessions. Per-trace metadata carries `session_id`, `agent_id`, `session_started_at`, `session_ended_at`, `session_metadata`, and `source: "hermes.session"`. Missing DB returns an empty summary (graceful, exit 0). 10 repository tests cover read-only refusal, missing-DB error path, since-filter, sequence order, schema drift (extra and missing columns), WAL/SHM-less open, and corrupt metadata JSON. 13 ingester tests cover end-to-end emission, shared-policy redaction, since/limit/dry-run, importer-never-mutates-DB invariant (mtime + size check), `--redact off` warning surfacing, per-trace metadata, invalid-`--since` rejection, and CLI integration. AC-706 closed.

- AC-706 (slice 1): `autoctx hermes ingest-trajectories --input <jsonl> --output <jsonl> --redact standard|strict|off` reads a Hermes trajectory JSONL file (ShareGPT-like, line-per-trajectory) and writes a redacted copy. Default `--redact standard` runs the existing `sharing/redactor` pipeline (Anthropic / OpenAI / AWS / GitHub / Slack keys, bearer tokens, emails, IPs, env values, absolute paths, high-risk file refs). `--redact strict` requires `--user-patterns` (a JSON array of `{name, pattern}` regex objects) and tags hits as `[REDACTED_USER_PATTERN:<name>]`. `--redact off` writes raw content and surfaces a CLI warning on the privacy posture (AC-706 requires explicit operator opt-in). `--dry-run` reports redaction counts without writing the output (AC-706 privacy preview). Per-line tolerance: corrupt JSON, non-object trajectories, and blank lines are skipped (not aborted) with per-line warnings. The redaction stats are returned per-category so operators can audit what was removed. New `autocontext.hermes.redaction` module exposes `RedactionPolicy`, `compile_user_patterns`, and `redact_text` as the shared policy surface that the AC-706 slice 2 (sessions) will reuse. 11 redaction-policy tests + 13 trajectory-ingester tests (including the CLI subcommand entry point and the input-never-mutated invariant). AC-706 slice 2 (`ingest-sessions` from `~/.hermes/state.db` with WAL/SHM tolerance and schema drift) is a follow-up; this slice ships the redaction primitives and the simpler JSONL surface first.

- AC-702: Hermes skill references for progressive disclosure. Adds `autocontext/src/autocontext/hermes/references.py` exposing 4 markdown references (`hermes-curator`, `cli-workflows`, `mcp-workflows`, `local-training`) accessible via `list_references()` / `render_reference(name)`. The rendered SKILL.md from `render_autocontext_skill()` now ends with a `## References` section that cross-links each one. `autoctx hermes export-skill --with-references --output <dir>/SKILL.md` writes the references next to the skill in a `references/` subdirectory; `--force` propagates to both SKILL.md and references. The skill remains useful on its own when `--with-references` is not passed. Atomic preflight: every destination is checked before any write so a reference-name collision can't leave SKILL.md half-installed. 12 tests cover canonical order, content invariants (read-only rule in curator alignment doc; concrete commands in CLI workflows; CLI-vs-MCP guidance in MCP workflows; small-dataset warning in local-training), SKILL.md cross-linking, the CLI overwrite-without-force guardrail, and the atomicity regression test.
- AC-705: `autoctx hermes export-dataset --kind curator-decisions --home ~/.hermes --output training/hermes-curator-decisions.jsonl` exports Hermes curator decision artifacts as supervised training JSONL for narrow advisor classifiers (per the AC-708 scope). Each row carries `example_id`, `source.curator_run_path`, `source.started_at`, `input.skill_{name,state,provenance,pinned,use_count,view_count,patch_count,activity_count,last_activity_at}`, `label` (`consolidated` | `pruned` | `archived` | `added`, strongest-wins precedence), `confidence: "strong"`, `redactions: []`, and `context.run_{provider,model,counts}`. Label quality rules pinned by tests: `pinned` skills NEVER become mutation targets; `bundled` and `hub` skills NEVER become mutation targets (they appear only as context). Skills missing from the inventory still emit an example with `unknown` features so historical curator decisions can be trained on. Both Hermes v0.12 action shapes are accepted (list of strings OR list of `{"name": ...}` dicts). `--since <ISO-8601>` raises ValueError on invalid input rather than silently disabling the filter; runs without parseable `started_at` fall back to file mtime for the comparison. Pinned-via-`.usage.json`, bundled-via-`.bundled_manifest`, and hub-via-`.hub/lock.json` names are protected even when no active SKILL.md folder exists. Other documented dataset kinds (`consolidation-pairs`, `skill-selection`, `skill-quality-signals`) raise `NotImplementedError` with a clear message so callers know they're planned but not yet implemented. 18 fixture-based tests cover schema, label quality rules, since/limit filters, unknown-kind dispatch, dict-shape actions, protected-name fallbacks, and --since hardening. Module docstring documents the full schema; the schema is intentionally flat and feature-engineered so it can feed `autoctx train --backend mlx|cuda` via a one-step adapter (the adapter is a follow-up). NOTE: small personal Hermes homes may not have enough data for useful model training yet -- the dataset shape ships first; usefulness depends on Curator-decision volume.
- AC-704: `autoctx hermes ingest-curator --home ~/.hermes --output traces/hermes-curator.jsonl` reads Hermes v0.12 curator run reports (`<home>/logs/curator/**/run.json`) and emits autocontext `ProductionTrace` JSONL. The ingester is tolerant: malformed JSON is skipped with a warning rather than aborting; missing `started_at` falls back to file mtime; missing `duration_seconds` falls back to 0. Curator action lists (consolidated/pruned/archived/added) and counts land in `trace.metadata.curator_*` so downstream dataset exporters (AC-705) can consume them without re-parsing raw files. Privacy defaults: `--include-llm-final` (off by default) gates whether the curator's LLM final summary is attached as an assistant message; `--include-tool-args` (off by default) gates whether raw tool-call args are preserved. `--since <ISO-8601>` and `--limit <n>` filter the run set. CLI returns a JSON summary (`runs_read`, `traces_written`, `skipped`, `warnings`) under `--json`. 11 fixture-based tests cover normal run / consolidation-only / auto-transition-only / malformed JSON / missing curator dir / since-filter / limit / synthesized-messages-satisfy-schema / include-llm-final opt-in / metadata round-trip / timing derivation.

- AC-710: `docs/hermes-positioning.md` records the Hermes Curator + autocontext positioning. Headline: Hermes Curator is the live skill-library maintainer; autocontext is the evaluation, trace, replay, export, and local-training layer. Includes an at-a-glance complementarity table, the default operator flow (`autoctx hermes inspect` -> `autoctx hermes export-skill` -> `autoctx judge` / `improve`), the read-only import boundary on `~/.hermes`, the privacy posture for session/trajectory imports, the narrow scope of `autoctx train` for advisor models, and an explicit "autocontext does not replace Curator" section. Cross-linked from `docs/README.md` "Integrating External Agents". Status footer enumerates shipped / in-flight / out-of-scope work so the doc stays accurate as the rest of the Hermes cluster lands.

- AC-682 (slice 1): TypeScript OpenTelemetry bridge for `PublicTrace`. New `ts/src/traces/otel-bridge.ts` exposes `publicTraceToOtelResourceSpans` (forward) and `otelResourceSpansToPublicTrace` (reverse) over a minimal validated subset of OTel JSON `ResourceSpans` (`OtelResourceSpansSchema` Zod). Bidirectional round-trip preserves traceId, sourceHarness (via `service.name`), `collectedAt`, sessionId, message order/content, tool calls (name/args/duration/error -> span `status.code = "ERROR"`), outcome (score/reasoning/dimensions), and redactions metadata. Reverse path validates the reconstructed trace against `PublicTraceSchema` before returning so a broken bridge cannot emit invalid traces. 11 tests cover schema validation, forward emission, round-trip, missing-service-name error path, missing-root-span error path, optional-outcome handling, zero-tool-call messages, and redaction preservation. Design note + mapping table at `docs/opentelemetry-bridge.md` enumerates the known-gap fields (file references, metadata, tool results) that survive as opaque JSON blobs rather than as structured OTel attributes. Python parity, OTLP protobuf wire format, and the ProductionTrace bridge are out of scope for slice 1.
- AC-725: `docs/flue-influences.md` design note records what the runtime workspace/session contract, scoped command/tool grants, child-agent task execution, and `cwd` discovery model borrowed from an external review, and what was explicitly NOT borrowed (no upstream dependency, no API names, no provider stack, no vocabulary replacement). Cross-linked from `docs/README.md` "Architecture And Parity"; the canonical `docs/concept-model.md` is intentionally NOT cross-linked to keep its vocabulary autocontext-native (a `tests/package-topology.test.ts` invariant pins this). Pins the guardrail that `sandbox` / `workspace` / `session` are runtime isolation/boundary concepts, not peer top-level product nouns alongside `Scenario` / `Mission`.
- AC-728: verifier-facing contract probes for terminal, service, and artifact tasks. Extends `ts/src/control-plane/contract-probes/index.ts` (previously only `probeDirectoryContract`) with three new pure probes: `probeTerminalContract` (exit code + required/forbidden stdout/stderr patterns), `probeServiceContract` (required endpoints with host/port/protocol matching + `wrong-interface` detection for `127.0.0.1` vs `0.0.0.0` confusion + optional allowed-endpoint allowlist), and `probeArtifactContract` (required/forbidden substrings + LF/CRLF line-ending check + required JSON fields via dot-paths with `invalid-json` failure when JSON parse fails). All probes follow the existing `{ passed: boolean, failures: readonly Failure[] }` shape; failures carry a typed `kind` for client filtering. 17 new tests + the existing directory probe test. Distributed/multi-rank parity probes deferred to a follow-up slice.
- AC-679 (slice 3b): `autoctx trace-findings --trace-id <id>` extends the slice-2 CLI to load a stored `ProductionTrace` by id from `.autocontext/production-traces/ingested/<date>/*.jsonl` (the local data plane that flows through `autoctx production-traces ingest`). `--trace <path>` and `--trace-id <id>` are mutually exclusive input modes; exactly one is required. The workflow adapts ProductionTrace to PublicTrace inline (flatten `source.emitter` -> `sourceHarness`, derive `collectedAt` from `timing.startedAt`, map outcome only when both `score` and `reasoning` are present, copy embedded `toolCalls` per message) so the slice-1 extractor runs unchanged. 5 new tests cover load + Markdown, JSON shape, missing-id error, mutual exclusivity, and the "neither flag" failure case. AC-679 is now substantively feature-complete (criteria 1-8 met); the only deferred work is additional taxonomy categories (slice 3e).
- AC-679 (slice 3d): `WeaknessReport` variant in `ts/src/analytics/trace-findings.ts`. Adds `WeaknessReportSchema` (Zod), `generateWeaknessReport(trace)`, and `renderWeaknessReportMarkdown(report)`. Mirrors Python's `WeaknessReport` shape (recommendation-focused with recovery analysis text) alongside the existing `TraceFindingReport`. Recommendations are one-per-distinct-category, deduplicated, sourced from a fixed `RECOMMENDATION_BY_CATEGORY` table. Recovery analysis is a narrative string composed from the outcome score and weakness count. 8 tests cover schema completeness, generation across the four taxonomy categories, deduplicated recommendations, and Markdown output sections / empty states.
- AC-679 (slice 3c): `renderTraceFindingReportHtml(report)` ships in `ts/src/analytics/trace-findings.ts`. Emits an offline-first self-contained HTML document with an inline `<style>` block, anchored finding rows (`id="finding-<id>"` so external references can link directly), and `data-category` + `data-severity` attributes on each `<li>` for client-side filtering hooks. Mirrors the shape of Python's `render_trace_writeup_html` so operator muscle memory transfers between the two runtimes. User-originated content (titles, descriptions, summary, traceId) is escaped through a single `htmlEscape` helper that handles `& < > " '`. 7 tests cover scaffolding, escaping, anchors, data attributes, empty states, offline-style block, and evidence references.
- AC-679 (slice 3a): cross-runtime TraceFindingReport JSON contract. A shared fixture at `fixtures/cross-runtime/trace-finding-report.json` (at repo root) is the wire-format contract that both Python and TypeScript validate against. Python adds `CrossRuntimeTraceFinding` / `CrossRuntimeFailureMotif` / `CrossRuntimeTraceFindingReport` Pydantic models at `analytics/cross_runtime_trace_findings.py` with camelCase JSON aliases mirroring the TS Zod schema; snake_case kwargs work for ergonomic Python use, `model_dump(by_alias=True)` is the canonical wire form. 9 Python tests + 6 TS tests on the same fixture catch shape/taxonomy/enum drift before a TS-produced report can fail to parse on Python (and vice versa). Closes AC-679 criterion 8 (cross-runtime contract tests catch Python/TS drift).
- AC-679 (slice 2): `autoctx trace-findings --trace <path> [--json]` CLI subcommand wires the slice-1 extractor library into an operator-facing TypeScript command. Reads a PublicTrace JSON file, runs `generateTraceFindingReport`, and emits the report as Markdown (default) or JSON. Handler is pure (`runTraceFindingsCommand(args) -> {stdout, stderr, exitCode}`) so the 11 unit tests drive it directly without subprocess spawn or stdout capture; the top-level `cli/index.ts` shim writes the result. Coupling to the ProductionTrace store (`--trace-id <id>`) and the extra slice-1-deferred taxonomy categories remain follow-up work.
- AC-679 (slice 1): TypeScript trace-finding extractor library at `analytics/trace-findings.ts`. Re-targets AC-679 to operate over `PublicTrace` (the TS data plane primitive) rather than mirroring Python's harness-internal RunTrace shape, so cross-runtime parity lives in the _output_ contract (`TraceFindingReportSchema` Zod schema) rather than the input trace. Slice 1 ships the Zod schemas (`TraceFindingSchema`, `FailureMotifSchema`, `TraceFindingReportSchema`), a four-category taxonomy targeting agent-behavior failures detectable from a PublicTrace (`tool_call_failure`, `agent_refusal`, `low_outcome_score`, `dimension_inconsistency`), pure extractor functions (`extractFindings`, `extractFailureMotifs`, `generateTraceFindingReport`), and `renderTraceFindingReportMarkdown`. Captures the agent-behavior axis that the AC-678 Python slice deferred. CLI subcommand, HTML rendering, additional categories (context loss / error-recovery loops), and cross-runtime fixture parity tests land in follow-up slices.
- AC-678 (slice): `autoctx analytics trace-findings --trace-id <id> [--kind writeup|weakness] [--json]` emits a trace-grounded findings report for a stored `RunTrace`. Exposes the existing `TraceReporter.generate_writeup` / `generate_weakness_report` pipeline as an operator CLI without changing the canonical report model; Markdown body matches the run-end-time writeup artifact. Reuses the `_validated_trace_id` traversal guard from `render-timeline`. Closes the headline AC-678 gap (Python report model existed without a CLI surface); semantic failure-taxonomy mapping beyond the current `event_type` grouping remains open.
- AC-749 (slice): `autoctx analytics render-timeline --trace-id <id> [--output path.html]` renders an existing persisted `RunTrace` as an interactive HTML timeline. On-demand counterpart to the run-end-time renderer that already lives in `loop/trace_artifacts.persist_run_inspection`; reuses the same `timeline_inspection_view` extractor + `render_timeline_inspection_html` view. The rendered HTML now also surfaces a "Generations" section with per-generation failure/recovery counts (data attributes `data-generation-index`, `data-generation-failure-count`, `data-generation-recovery-count` for client-side hooks). The view layer exposes the same `inspect_generation` data the JSON payload already carries -- no new analytics model.
- Harness proposal decisions now require explicit evidence references before heldout/fresh validation can accept or reject a proposal. Missing `--evidence-ref` keeps the durable decision `inconclusive`, and corrupted accepted/rejected proposal JSON with empty `evidenceRefs`, dev-only evidence, or missing baseline evidence is rejected by schema validation.
- Python and TypeScript prompt budgeting now share a domain policy for canonical duplicate-context removal, per-component token caps, protected components, and trim order; semantic compaction also caches repeated component compactions by policy version and content hash.
- AC-727 (slice): `autoctx improve --checkpoint-cmd` runs a user-supplied command after each round to preserve partial progress (e.g. `git -C /repo commit -am 'round checkpoint'` or `cp {file} /tmp/round.lean`). Same `{file}` placeholder semantics as `--verify-cmd`, plus `--checkpoint-suffix` and `--checkpoint-timeout` companions. Unlike the verifier, a checkpoint command's non-zero exit is logged but does NOT veto the round; it surfaces as a new `checkpoint_done(round=N, checkpoint_ok=..., checkpoint_exit_code=...)` event in the `--ndjson` stream. Lets long-running improve loops salvage near-miss artifacts before later rounds overshoot or time out.
- AC-723: the TypeScript CLI now exposes `autoctx agent run <agent>` and `autoctx agent dev` for experimental `.autoctx/agents` handlers. The one-shot runner accepts `--id`, JSON `--payload`, explicit `--env` files with shell env precedence, provider/model overrides for runtime-backed handlers, and `--json` output; the dev server exposes `GET /manifest` and `POST /agents/<name>/invoke`.
- Context-selection analytics reports now include actionable diagnostics for duplicate selected content, low useful-artifact recall, and selected-token bloat.
- Python analytics now includes `autoctx analytics context-selection --run-id <run-id> [--json]` to summarize persisted context-selection artifacts by selected tokens, selection rate, duplicate-content rate, useful-artifact recall, and freshness.
- AC-757: TypeScript control-plane EvalRuns now support `verified` and `experimental` tracks. `autoctx eval attach` accepts `--track verified|experimental`, `eval list --output json` reports the effective track, and promotion decisions reject explicitly experimental EvalRuns as non-promotion evidence.
- AC-758: Candidate artifacts now record deterministic strategy identity metadata: a canonical strategy fingerprint, component fingerprints, parent strategy lineage, and exact/near duplicate assessment. `autoctx candidate register/show` include the metadata, and `candidate list` surfaces the strategy fingerprint and duplicate kind.
- AC-759: Candidate artifacts now quarantine repeated invalid strategies by fingerprint. Re-registering an exact or near duplicate of a disabled/quarantined strategy records `strategyQuarantine`, `candidate list` surfaces `quarantineReason`, promotion decisions reject quarantined strategies, and operational memory skips findings tied to quarantined strategy fingerprints.
- AC-760: EvalRuns can now carry opt-in ablation verification evidence for accepted strategy and harness changes. `autoctx eval attach` accepts `--ablation-verification ./ablation.json`, `promotion decide --require-ablation` records an `ablationVerification` assessment, and `--ablation-targets strategy,harness` narrows the required target coverage.
- AC-680: TypeScript control-plane harness/context changes now have a durable `HarnessChangeProposal` workflow. `autoctx harness proposal create/list/show/decide` records finding lineage, proposed patches, expected impact, rollback criteria, and an evidence-gated decision that accepts only heldout/fresh validation against matching-suite baseline evidence.
- Strategy duplicate and quarantine checks now span all environments for the same scenario/actuator and use `payloadHash` as an exact-match fallback for legacy artifacts without `strategyIdentity`.
- AC-752: `autoctx improve --ndjson` streams per-round events as newline-delimited JSON to stdout for visibility into long-running loops. Event kinds: `round_start`, `judge_done`, `verifier_done` (only when `--verify-cmd` is set), `round_summary`, and a final summary line. Under `--ndjson` the Rich human-readable summary is suppressed so stdout is pure JSON. `--json` and `--ndjson` are mutually exclusive output modes and are rejected up front when both are passed.
- AC-753: the ndjson stream now also emits a `revision_done(round=N, output=<content>)` event right after `round_start` for every round, carrying the exact output the loop is about to evaluate. For round 1 the payload is the seed; for round N>1 it is the result of `task.revise_output()` from round N-1. Lets consumers salvage near-miss verifier-vetoed rounds. Pass `--no-ndjson-include-output` (default `--ndjson-include-output`) to suppress these events when the bulk output is unwanted; that flag drops the `revision_done` event entirely and never writes the output payload anywhere on stdout.
- AC-751: `autoctx improve --claude-max-total-seconds FLOAT` exposes `settings.claude_max_total_seconds` (the wall-clock ceiling on total claude-cli runtime in a single run; env: `AUTOCONTEXT_CLAUDE_MAX_TOTAL_SECONDS`). Only applied when the effectively-resolved judge provider is claude-cli; `judge_provider='auto'` paths that inherit `agent_provider='claude-cli'` are honored. `--timeout` help on `improve` now explicitly names the per-provider setting it writes (`claude_timeout`/`codex_timeout`/`pi_timeout`).
- Python and TypeScript now expose `autoctx worker` to run the existing task queue `TaskRunner` as a daemon or one-shot batch worker, with persistent-host deployment docs for `serve + worker`.
- Added narrow Python/TypeScript task queue store contracts so future hosted storage adapters can provide Postgres-backed claim/complete/fail/enqueue semantics without changing `TaskRunner`.
- Gondolin is documented as a reserved optional microVM sandbox backend, fails closed until a real adapter is configured, and now has public request/policy/backend contracts for out-of-tree adapters.
- TypeScript `autoctx runtime-sessions` now lists, shows, and renders operator-facing timelines for persisted runtime-session event logs from CLI-backed provider runs, including `show --run-id <run-id>` and `timeline --run-id <run-id>` for run-scoped logs; `status`, `show`, and `watch --json` surface a `runtime_session` summary when one exists, MCP exposes the same read surface via `list_runtime_sessions`, `get_runtime_session`, and `get_runtime_session_timeline`, cockpit HTTP clients can read logs and timelines from `/api/cockpit/runtime-sessions`, `/api/cockpit/runtime-sessions/:session_id/timeline`, `/api/cockpit/runs/:run_id/runtime-session`, and `/api/cockpit/runs/:run_id/runtime-session/timeline`, cockpit run list/status/resume payloads include `runtime_session` plus `runtime_session_url` for discovery, the interactive TUI exposes `/timeline <run-id>` for the same grouped view and summarizes live runtime-session activity as it arrives with persisted `/activity` filters, quiet/normal/verbose detail controls, `/activity reset`, read-only bare `/activity` and `/activity status`, and startup readback of loaded activity settings, and `/ws/events` streams live `runtime_session_event` envelopes as runtime-session events are appended.
- Python now has parity readers for runtime-session event logs: a TypeScript-compatible event/store/read-model/timeline layer, cockpit endpoints for listing logs and resolving run-scoped timelines, run list/status/resume discovery fields, and MCP tools `autocontext_list_runtime_sessions`, `autocontext_get_runtime_session`, and `autocontext_get_runtime_session_timeline` with unprefixed aliases.
- Python runtime-backed run and solve role calls now automatically append provider prompts and responses to the run-scoped runtime-session log, preserving runtime failure semantics while making the new Python readers useful without manual recorder wiring.
- Python now exposes a core `RuntimeWorkspaceEnv` contract with local filesystem and in-memory adapters, virtual path resolution, scoped command grants, and explicit cleanup semantics to match the TypeScript runtime workspace boundary.
- TypeScript runtime workspace command grants now expose structured start/end/error observability events, a no-shell local process wrapper with explicit env inheritance, redacted/truncated command output previews, child-task inheritance policy, and scoped command/tool grant types for runtime-session calls without serializing trusted env values into prompts or session logs.
- The canonical concept model now documents durable runtime-session event storage as an `Artifact` model for provider turns, shell/tool activity, child-task lineage, compaction summaries, replay, and the boundary with `RunTrace`/production traces.
- Python and TypeScript runtime-session logs now record semantic compaction ledger writes as `COMPACTION` events with entry ids, component names, ledger paths, and generation metadata for replay timelines; TypeScript records the hook-finalized ledger entries and paths after artifact write hooks run.
- Python and TypeScript now expose explicit runtime-session-to-`RunTrace` adapters for analytics reuse, mapping child-task lineage, command/tool status, and compaction artifact references without copying raw prompts, model responses, stdout/stderr, or arbitrary runtime metadata.

### Fixed

- AC-764 / AC-765: Python and TypeScript Pi CLI runtimes no longer rely on raw `subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)` / `execFileSync(..., { timeout })` cleanup. Both runtimes now isolate `pi --print` in a subprocess/session where supported, kill the full process group on timeout, close inherited stdout/stderr pipes, bound post-kill cleanup to 5s, and preserve timeout metadata (`error: "timeout"`, timeout seconds) for callers. Regression coverage includes process-group kill, interrupted/abnormal cleanup, and leaked-pipe timeout return paths.
- AC-761 / AC-735: claude-cli subprocesses are now hard-killed at their process group on timeout AND on any other abnormal exit (`KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`, ...). The previous code path used `subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)`, which only `proc.kill()`s the immediate child; claude-cli helper processes that inherit pipe fds kept the post-kill `communicate()` drain open, so a `--timeout 1200` invocation observed at 2h24m alive (AC-761) and `AUTOCONTEXT_CLAUDE_MAX_TOTAL_SECONDS=28800` runs observed at 8h45m (AC-735). The runtime now spawns claude in its own session (`start_new_session=True`) and `os.killpg(pgid, SIGKILL)`s the whole group, with a bounded 5s grace on the post-kill drain. Because `start_new_session=True` also detaches the child from the terminal's signal-delivery group, Ctrl-C / SIGINT no longer reaches the claude process group automatically; the helper's `except BaseException` branch (PR #940 review) ensures interrupted runs still clean up the detached children before re-raising. Wall-clock returns within `claude_timeout + 5s` even when grandchildren hold pipes open. POSIX only; Windows uses `proc.kill()` fallback.
- AC-756: `ImprovementResult.met_threshold` now consistently mirrors the same predicate used by the early-return paths -- the best round both cleared `quality_threshold` and satisfied `dimension_threshold` if one was configured. Previously the fallthrough exit (plateau-stall, unchanged-output, max-rounds, consecutive-failures) hard-coded `met_threshold=False`, so a run that produced above-threshold output via, e.g., a plateau-stall path was flagged as "didn't meet threshold" and could be discarded by automation. The fix tracks `best_dims_ok` alongside `best_score` so the per-dimension gate is honored at fallthrough exits too.
- AC-754: `ImprovementLoop` now peels off an outer markdown code fence (e.g. ` ```lean ... ``` `) when cleaning agent output, so verifiers that compile the output directly (`lake env lean`, `mypy`, `cargo check`, ...) no longer reject otherwise-valid content on the literal fence lines. Applied to both the seed (round 1's input) and the result of every `task.revise_output()` call. The strip is conservative: only the outer wrapper is removed, inner nested fences and unbalanced fences are preserved.
- AC-750: `ImprovementLoop` no longer fires a misleading `max_score_delta` warning when the previous round was zeroed by the external `--verify-cmd` verifier. The loop now tracks `last_unvetoed_score` separately from `prev_valid_score`; the delta check compares against the last legitimate judge score, while plateau detection still treats consecutive verifier vetoes as a stall.
- Runtime-session event stores now preserve existing events when saving stale or partial logs, and the TypeScript timeline pairs repeated child-task completions by child session id before falling back to task aliases.
- Worker commands now clamp concurrency to one for stateful persistent runtimes, and Python runtime-bridge providers close underlying runtimes on shutdown.
- TypeScript task runners now await queue-store methods so hosted Postgres adapters can implement the queue contract asynchronously.
- AC-733..AC-738 batch from the putnam_2013_a5 stress test: `improve` now exposes `--verify-cmd`/`--verify-suffix`/`--verify-timeout` for compile/test gates that can force score=0 and feed stderr back into revision; `solve` accepts `--task-prompt` to bypass the LLM scenario designer (which truncated long Lean/Putnam-style prompts), `--task-file` for file-backed descriptions, `--generations` as an alias for `--gens`, and `-d` short form for `--description`; `--family` typos surface a `did_you_mean` suggestion via the new `FamilyName` value object instead of silently falling through; `AUTOCONTEXT_CLAUDE_TOOLS=""` now renders as a single `--tools=` argv token rather than a stray double-space; and `AUTOCONTEXT_CLAUDE_MAX_TOTAL_SECONDS` (default `0`/off) attaches a `RuntimeBudget` to every settings-driven `ClaudeCLIRuntime` (default agent provider, per-role overrides, and the judge/provider registry path), with retry backoff sleeps bounded by both the per-invocation cap and the attached budget.

### Changed

- Python `autocontext` and TypeScript `autoctx` package metadata are bumped to `0.5.1` for the Pi CLI timeout-hardening release. Follow-up Pi `pi-autocontext` package metadata is bumped to `0.2.5`, its extension imports and peer dependencies are migrated to the Pi 0.74 `@earendil-works/*` / `typebox` package names, and its `autoctx` dependency now requires the hardened `^0.5.1` line.
- Default of `AUTOCONTEXT_CLAUDE_MAX_TOTAL_SECONDS` is now `0` (disabled, opt-in). Set explicitly when you want a wall-clock cap on total Claude CLI runtime; the per-invocation retry cap inside `ClaudeCLIConfig` keeps its 25-minute default for in-process retry sequences.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Python and TypeScript `autoctx solve` now accept the plain-language goal as a positional argument while keeping `--description` as a named option.
- Python and TypeScript `solve`/`run` commands now accept `--iterations` as the plain-language alias for `--gens`.
- Python and TypeScript `autoctx run <scenario>` now accept a positional scenario while keeping `--scenario` for scripts.
- Python and TypeScript `autoctx export <run-id>` now export knowledge from a specific run while keeping scenario-level export support.
- TypeScript CLI/TUI help now uses the same plain-language run vocabulary, including `status <run-id>`, `show <run-id> --best`, and `watch <run-id>`.
- Python `autoctx hermes inspect` now reads Hermes v0.12 skill usage telemetry and Curator reports without mutating `~/.hermes`, and `autoctx hermes export-skill` emits a first-class Hermes `autocontext` skill that teaches CLI-first workflows with MCP as optional.

### Fixed

- Python installed `autoctx` no longer crashes on no-args startup when packaged banner assets are missing.

### Changed

- Python `autocontext` and TypeScript `autoctx` package metadata are bumped to `0.5.0`.
- Pi `pi-autocontext` package metadata is bumped to `0.2.4`, and its `autoctx` dependency range accepts both the current `0.4.9` package and the upcoming `0.5.0` npm line.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- TypeScript `simulate` now uses the schema-evolution scenario designer for schema-evolution prompts and rejects zero-mutation generated specs before persistence (AC-694).
- Python Pi/Pi-RPC budget errors now report the effective bounded role timeout instead of the original unbounded Pi timeout (AC-695).
- RLM sessions can soft-finalize from explicit final-answer tags, cautious natural-language closure cues, and repeated silent no-progress turns, while preserving real inspection progress (AC-696).
- Rubric drift monitoring now flags within-generation mean-versus-best compression and catches slower dimension decline patterns (AC-686).

### Changed

- Python `autocontext` and TypeScript `autoctx` package metadata are bumped to `0.4.9`.
- Pi `pi-autocontext` package metadata is bumped to `0.2.3` while intentionally keeping its `autoctx` dependency one package behind at `^0.4.8`.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- TypeScript generated `schema_evolution` scenarios no longer score empty mutation plans as perfect, and generated actions now record mutation lineage before schema-coverage scoring (AC-666).
- Python Claude CLI runtime calls now use bounded timeout retries with exponential backoff, total wall-clock caps, retry metadata, and warning/error logs for long-running live-agent calls (AC-684).
- Python solve now enforces generation budgets across Pi/Pi-RPC role calls, including per-role overrides, and closes one-shot budgeted persistent Pi RPC clients after use (AC-691).
- TypeScript schema-evolution creation now recovers from Pi-style invalid JSON responses with markdown fences, prose wrappers, comments, trailing commas, and camelCase fields (AC-692).
- Python solve JSON/status output now includes resolved scenario-family metadata for stress harnesses and user workflows (AC-693).
- Iterative investigation no longer requires resolving the architect runtime before the first analyst step.
- Task-like solve lifecycle hooks now report persisted generation counts separately from improvement rounds.

### Changed

- Python `autocontext` and TypeScript `autoctx` package metadata are bumped to `0.4.8`.
- Pi `pi-autocontext` package metadata is bumped to `0.2.2` while intentionally keeping its `autoctx` dependency one package behind at `^0.4.7`.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Python `autoctx export` now accepts `--format pi-package` to write a Pi-local package directory with `package.json`, `SKILL.md`, prompt markdown, and the original autocontext strategy payload.
- Python and TypeScript autocontext now expose Pi-shaped extension hook buses via `AUTOCONTEXT_EXTENSIONS`, covering run/generation lifecycle, context transforms, semantic compaction, provider requests/responses, judge calls, and artifact writes.
- Pi `pi-autocontext` now exposes `autocontext_runtime_snapshot` for run artifacts, package provenance, session branch lineage, and recent event-stream context.
- TypeScript Pi RPC now supports an opt-in persistent runtime via `AUTOCONTEXT_PI_RPC_PERSISTENT=true`, reusing one `pi --mode rpc` subprocess for prompt and live-control calls.
- TypeScript CLI now exposes `autoctx solve` as a DB-backed solve-on-demand entrypoint with `--description`, `--gens`, `--timeout`, and `--json` support (AC-619).
- TypeScript solve now preserves Python-shaped controls for structured family overrides, per-generation runtime-budget enforcement, output file writing, and classifier fallback status metadata (AC-620).

### Fixed

- TypeScript capabilities now report the provider factory support surface and no longer mark the visible `train` command as Python-only (AC-626).
- TypeScript `run` now supports saved custom `agent_task` scenarios through the agent-task improvement runner instead of rejecting scenarios already discoverable in the control plane (AC-625).

### Changed

- Restructured the top-level `README.md`: leads with the Pi runtime quick start, adds an MCP-driven natural-language entry path ("Or Just Talk To Your Agent"), shows a structured artifact tree with concrete `playbook.md` and `trace.jsonl` excerpts, surfaces production-trace capture as its own section, merges the surfaces table with command examples, and adds a short FAQ. Removes redundant "How People Use It" / "Choose An Entry Point" / "Repository Layout" sections (the last is already covered in `AGENTS.md`).
- Bumped subpackage README references from `0.4.4` to `0.4.7` (`autocontext/README.md`, `ts/README.md`) to track the next release line.
- Python `autocontext`, TypeScript `autoctx`, and Pi `pi-autocontext` package metadata are bumped for the release.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Browser integration surface** (AC-598–603): Chrome CDP backend for Python (`autocontext.integrations.browser`) and TypeScript (`autoctx/integrations/browser`), wired into investigations and the task queue. Includes a browser exploration contract, cross-runtime validation fixtures, parity enforcement, and selector generation for CDP element refs.
- **A2-III Anthropic integration**: `instrument_client` / `InstrumentedAsyncAnthropic` (Python) and `instrumentClient` (TypeScript) intercept Anthropic SDK calls and route production traces through the autocontext pipeline, with `AnthropicStreamProxy`/`AnthropicStreamProxyAsync` for streaming and `AnthropicTaxonomyMapper` for outcome classification. Available at `autocontext.integrations.anthropic` and `autoctx/integrations/anthropic`. Includes cross-runtime parity (9 fixtures + 50-run property tests), anthropic-python/ts detector plugins, bundle-size enforcement, and zero-telemetry guarantee.
- **Production traces `build-dataset` filters** (AC-606): `--provider`, `--app`, `--env`, and `--outcome` filters on the `build-dataset` CLI and MCP tool, plus an E2E integration test covering OpenAI + Anthropic traces through ingest→build-dataset.
- Hierarchical investigation evidence with evidence cards cache and artifact drill-down hardening.
- Tail context preservation in secondary prompt reducer surfaces.
- Solve runtime floor raised for generated scenarios.

### Fixed

- Provider proxy runtime plumbing centralized into a shared `_shared/proxy-runtime` module so Anthropic and OpenAI integration proxies share consistent lifecycle and error handling (AC-611).
- TypeScript scenario family designers now share response parsing across agent-task, artifact-editing, and tool-fragility families so generated specs preserve family-specific semantics (AC-612).
- Install salt identity invariant preserved across process restarts (AC-609).
- Cross-runtime migration ledger reconciliation so Python and TypeScript DBs stay aligned after schema divergence (AC-608).
- CLI dispatch moved into a command registry so mission routes resolve correctly (AC-610).
- Babel reverse solve designer retries restored and scenario creation stabilized (AC-607).

### Changed

- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.4.6`.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- `quality_threshold` auto-heal no longer silently drops below the configured floor during multi-round improvement loops (AC-585).
- Judge-provider inheritance now propagates correctly to nested evaluation calls so role-routing overrides are honored end-to-end (AC-586).
- Claude CLI timeout default bumped from 300 to 600 seconds, reducing spurious failures in longer live-agent solve runs (AC-588).
- Release-sweep accounting hardened to prevent double-counting across concurrent sweep legs.

### Added

- Added a shared browser exploration contract and package-safe configuration surface across Python and TypeScript, including canonical schemas, validation helpers, secure `AUTOCONTEXT_BROWSER_*` defaults, and policy helpers.
- Added the TypeScript Chrome DevTools Protocol backend for browser exploration, including attach-only target discovery, websocket transport, policy-gated actions, and evidence artifacts.
- Added Python browser exploration integration for investigations and queued tasks, including policy-gated snapshot capture, prompt/evidence enrichment, and fail-closed task-runner wiring.
- Added a thin Python Chrome CDP browser backend with debugger-target discovery, evidence persistence, WebSocket transport, runtime factory, and policy-checked session actions.
- Added cross-runtime browser contract fixtures so Python and TypeScript validators stay in lockstep.
- Added TypeScript browser-context integration for investigations, queued tasks, and MCP queueing, including fail-closed navigation policy handling and artifact-backed browser evidence.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added the production-traces contract and traffic-to-eval pipeline across Python and TypeScript, including cross-runtime schemas, emit/validate helpers, redaction, retention, dataset building, CLI/MCP surfaces, and golden integration flows.
- Added the TypeScript control-plane `model-routing` actuator plus the published `chooseModel` runtime helper for deterministic route, rollout, guardrail, fallback, and trace-integrated model selection.
- Added Python solve ergonomics for family overrides and improved classifier observability/fallback vocabulary for finance, schema-evolution, geopolitical simulation, and alignment-stress prompts.

### Fixed

- Hardened Python scenario design and solve paths around malformed designer responses, intent-drift retry feedback, mandatory calibration examples, structured quality thresholds, readable sample prompts, and schema/geopolitical simulate routing.
- Preserved the latest control-plane hardening while restacking the production-traces/model-routing foundation, including candidate artifact boundary validation and model-routing payload registration.

### Changed

- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.4.4`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Hardened Pi-backed solve/runtime execution so Pi RPC waits for assistant completion, honors model/context-file options consistently, and solve runs enforce timeout budgets.
- Preserved generated-scenario family behavior across solve, export, TypeScript `new-scenario`, and `improve` flows, including empty-action family specs and improve calls without an initial output.
- Made custom scenario loading resilient and diagnosable: malformed specs no longer block registry discovery, spec-only directories surface actionable diagnostics, import-time missing files keep their real reason, and non-agent family specs can auto-materialize Python `scenario.py` sources.
- Normalized structured agent-task prompt payloads before validation and code generation, so JSON-like sample inputs, reference context, preparation instructions, and revision prompts no longer crash generated runtimes.

### Changed

- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.4.3`.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Preserved TypeScript workflow and custom-scenario semantics across broader scenario generation, including workflow compensation/side-effect metadata and camelCase final score weights.
- Hardened Python judge, improve, simulate, and list CLI flows around timeout overrides, fresh workspaces, provider overrides, rubric guardrails, and simulation-family routing.
- Added the Python `autoctx investigate` surface with generation fallbacks and kept its CLI implementation below the repository module-size gate.
- Restored Python `autoctx queue add --task-prompt ... --rubric ...` compatibility for prompt-backed queued tasks, including direct ad hoc queueing without a saved spec name.

### Changed

- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.4.2`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Restored operator-loop escalation accounting when explicit escalation actions also mention clarification, so generated Python scenarios preserve both escalation and clarification signals.
- Preserved operator-loop family routing through Python solve creation and replay-safe feedback validation without violating the Pydantic serialization convention.
- Routed TypeScript `new-scenario` operator-loop requests through the dedicated family designer and allowed generated operator-loop scenarios to execute through the solve codegen path.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.4.1`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- Refactored the TypeScript platform foundation, analytics/trace/training, and control-plane integration surfaces into thinner workflow modules while preserving CLI, MCP, and package parity.
- Hardened the extracted package-surface workflows around typed MCP tool boundaries, simulation dashboard report parsing, and deterministic simulation score normalization.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.4.0`.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- TypeScript `autoctx campaign` CLI with create, status, list, add-mission, progress, pause, resume, and cancel subcommands, completing the CLI surface for CampaignManager (AC-533).
- Campaign API endpoints and MCP tools for multi-mission coordination with budget tracking and dependency graphs.

### Changed

- Standardized Anthropic credential loading around `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` while keeping `AUTOCONTEXT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a compatibility alias across Python and TypeScript settings.
- Added optional role-scoped credential and endpoint overrides (`AUTOCONTEXT_{ROLE}_API_KEY`, `AUTOCONTEXT_{ROLE}_BASE_URL`) for `competitor`, `analyst`, `coach`, and `architect`, falling back to the global provider configuration when unset.

### Fixed

- Python `autoctx simulate` now resolves live generation through the effective architect-role runtime surface, so `AUTOCONTEXT_ARCHITECT_PROVIDER` and other role-routing overrides are honored instead of being bypassed by the raw client builder.
- Python simulation spec normalization now tolerates LLM-friendly action/spec shapes such as `postconditions`, nested criteria objects, and extra action-planning metadata without failing code generation.
- Structured simulation preconditions now preserve referenced action ids when LLM output includes both an `action` field and human-readable prose, so generated dependencies remain executable.
- Regenerating a custom scenario with the same name in one process now force-reloads the generated module so `solve` and creator validation do not reuse stale scenario classes from `sys.modules`.
- Pi-backed live flows now default to a 300 second timeout, reducing spurious failures in longer `solve` runs.
- Public docs now describe `operator-in-the-loop` as a runnable family and no longer contradict the executable tests.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- Hardened bootstrap, evidence, and privacy handling so environment snapshots redact shell paths correctly, rematerialized workspaces do not retain stale artifacts, and live prompt/evidence flows now wire the collected snapshot and evidence manifest into the real loop.
- Tightened scenario-generation safety in the TypeScript surface so `operator_loop` validation requires its real escalation/clarification hooks and spec auto-heal preserves punctuation-heavy precondition dependencies instead of dropping valid ordering.
- Improved evidence and security backstops by failing closed on TruffleHog execution errors and making the evidence workspace/MCP integration rely on a materialized runtime workspace instead of dead helper-only paths.
- Hardened blob-store backends so local keys cannot escape the configured root and Hugging Face bucket metadata/list/delete behavior remains accurate across fresh process boundaries.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.3.6`.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-06

### Changed

- Stabilized the post-`0.3.4` simulation path so operator-loop scenarios preserve behavioral-contract signals across multi-run, sweep, and replay flows instead of silently dropping them.
- Hardened plain-language simulation execution around explicit family detection, operator-loop contract enforcement, and shared CLI engine-result handling so incomplete runs surface consistently across Python and TypeScript surfaces.
- Tightened the simulation-engine implementation without regressing the repo module-size guardrail, including the compatibility shim needed by existing abstract-class filtering tests.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.3.5`.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- Added action-label and living-docs surfaces to the operator workflow, including reviewer-driven cleanup on the action-label taxonomy and living-docs maintenance path.
- Landed the TypeScript/Python parity tranche for session store and the full research package, keeping the rebased cross-surface runtime behavior aligned on current `main`.
- Folded in the `pi-autocontext` polish follow-up so the published Pi package line reflects the renamed extension and its best-practices cleanup.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.3.4`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- Expanded the research surface with validated domain contracts, runtime gating, persistence hardening, and better evaluation wiring for briefs, prompts, and adapters.
- Hardened Python and TypeScript operator-control surfaces around terminal lifecycle transitions, remote approvals, progress digests, and agentOS session/runtime error handling.
- Improved SQLite bootstrap and migration compatibility so packaged installs and fresh databases stay aligned with the live generation schema.
- Expanded the TypeScript provider compatibility surface with env-driven config for `gemini`, `mistral`, `groq`, `openrouter`, and `azure-openai`, and synced the public provider docs/tests to match.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.3.3`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Completed the TypeScript session-runtime parity pass across lifecycle management, coordinator state transitions, supervision, context pressure, remote approvals, progress digests, memory consolidation, and skill registry behavior.
- Hardened the TypeScript operator control plane so terminal session and worker states stay terminal, remote approvals require connected controllers, and redirected work remains visible in progress summaries.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.3.2`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Python package publishing now uses the canonical PyPI name `autocontext` instead of `autoctx`.
- Public install docs now reflect the package split accurately: PyPI is `autocontext`, while npm remains `autoctx`.
- Python and TypeScript package metadata are bumped to `0.3.1`.
