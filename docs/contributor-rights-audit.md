# Contributor Rights Audit Historical Snapshot

This is the AC-646 rights-audit historical snapshot that was created during the
abandoned dual-license investigation. It now supports provenance context for the
deferred package-boundary notes in
[`core-control-package-split.md`](./core-control-package-split.md).

This document is an engineering audit, not legal advice. It records what git
history could prove at the time of the audit. It is no longer a go/no-go gate
for relicensing this repository: existing public repo code remains Apache-2.0,
and future proprietary work should live in a separate repo under its own
license.

## Current Status

- Audit snapshot: `0aa0114e` (`main`, after production-trace SDK build helper)
- License strategy status: existing public repo code remains Apache-2.0.
- Historical relicensing status: **out of scope**.
- Grey Haven confirmation received on 2026-04-28: contributions authored under
  `cirdan-greyhaven` are treated as a Grey Haven-controlled contributor identity
  for this engineering audit.
- Current blocker: none for boundary wrap-up. This audit would need fresh legal
  review only if the project reopens historical relicensing later.
- Repository records checked: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/`, docs, and root
  license files. No CLA, DCO, copyright assignment, or contributor license
  agreement was found in-repo.
- The controlled-identity confirmation and empty current path-specific block
  list are preserved here as historical context.

## Historical Summary

| Area                                 | Current evidence                                                                                                                                                                              | Current treatment                                                                       |

| Grey Haven-controlled affected paths | Git history/blame show Jay Scambler identities and `cirdan-greyhaven` identities confirmed as Grey Haven-controlled in the current source lines for previously audited candidate path groups. | Historical provenance context only; existing code remains Apache-2.0.                   |
| Path-specific third-party blockers   | No current non-Grey-Haven-controlled source-line blockers were found in the audited path groups after recording the Cirdan identity confirmation.                                             | No blocker for boundary wrap-up; re-run only if historical relicensing is reconsidered. |
| Gingiris contribution                | Git history shows one contribution touching `README.md` and `autocontext/src/autocontext/banner.py`.                                                                                          | Keep the touched files Apache-2.0 with the rest of the existing repo.                   |
| AC-645 license metadata              | Superseded by the deferred split policy.                                                                                                                                                      | Re-scope only if Apache metadata hygiene needs it.                                      |

## Affected Path Groups Audited

The audit used the package/path split documents that existed at the time as the
source of truth for code that might have moved into a non-Apache control-plane
tier. This framing is now historical; current boundary work keeps the existing
repo Apache-2.0.

## Current Path-Specific Blockers

No current path-specific third-party blocker remains relevant to the boundary
wrap-up because the existing repo is staying Apache-2.0.

This does **not** approve non-Apache relicensing. It records that historical
relicensing is out of scope. If Grey Haven later reopens historical relicensing,
this audit should be treated as stale input and rerun with legal review.

## Follow-Up

1. Preserve the 2026-04-28 confirmation that `cirdan-greyhaven` contributions
   are treated as a Grey Haven-controlled contributor identity in the AC-646
   Linear/PR records.
2. Keep existing `gingiris` contributions Apache-2.0 with the rest of the
   public repo.
3. Put future proprietary work in a separate repo under its own license rather
   than trying to reclassify historical files in this repo.

## Reproduction Commands

Contributor history by path group was generated from `git log` over the audited
paths. Current-line evidence was generated from `git blame --line-porcelain` and
canonicalized into the identity groups above.

Useful checks:

```bash
git shortlog -sne HEAD

git log --format='%H%x09%an%x09%ae%x09%aI%x09%s' -- \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/server \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/mcp \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/monitor \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/notebook \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/openclaw \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/sharing \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/research \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/training \
  autocontext/src/autocontext/consultation \
  packages/python/control

git blame --line-porcelain -- autocontext/src/autocontext/mcp/server.py
```

The audit should be regenerated only if the project reopens historical
relicensing. It is not required for Apache package-boundary wrap-up.
